When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Backups are regularly done and being remote allows easier collaboration with other people on a project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually give more control over when new differences are brought into the file set currently in use. That could set back current work trying to resolve issues in the current work in progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Clones are copies of a whole repository either within the same github user repository or from the github user repository to the same users local computer. Forks are copies of a different users repository to either my repository space and then to my own computer's local git repository. A branch is a line of modification of all or parts of a repositorys files parallel to the main branch.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   Having a local copy of the last known state of a remote allows you to continue working offline anywhere/time until you can get online to merge changes and continue with work.
